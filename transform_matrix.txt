The CSS matrix() function can be used with CSS transforms to style elements in a two-dimensional space.
The matrix() function is an alternative to the two-dimensional transform functions:
 rotate() , skew() , scale() , and translate() .
  In other words, you can use the matrix() function instead of those functions.
  
The matrix() method combines all the 2D transform methods into one.
The matrix() method take six parameters, containing mathematic functions, which allows you to
rotate, scale, move (translate), and skew elements.

The parameters are as follow: matrix(scaleX(), skewY(), skewX(), scaleY(), translateX(), translateY())
